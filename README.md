## My process

I started doing the mobile version first. I checked the style guides for the resources like font families and font sizes. I then basically just started the html markup keeping in mind the best practises. (That I'm aware of...) I then kept the design image in one tab and started styling the html to what I thought was closest to the design.

### Built with

- SASS 
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While uploading the files I actually forgot about the hover interactions so I quickly deleted the repo and added those! What I learnt in that part was that you could actually trigger other elements based on hover! I had to do this for the display of the "eye" icon. So that was cool!

### Continued development

What I want to focus on a little more in these projects is accessibility rules and best practises. I also want to make reuseable, efficient code. 

### Useful resources

- [Hover](https://www.w3schools.com/csSref/sel_hover.asp) - This is where I learnt how to do that simple trigger thing for other elements!
